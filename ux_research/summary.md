# Summary of UX Research

## Users Interviewed
We interviewed Julian Nadeau. Julian belongs to our potential customers' target age group. He has experience working with retail companies and so he understands their perspective well. He has worked at Shopify, Github and is currently a Staff Engineer at Stripe. 

We interviewed Sarrah Merchant who is a 22 year old living in Toronto, Canada. Sarah enjoys shopping online and often has difficulty finding the correct sizes of items to buy. She has a lot of experience with online shopping and does so frequently. Her personalized style is very important to her. 

We interviewed Ayush Kumar who is a 23 year old living in Toronto, Canada. Ayush is a working professional in tech. He is relatively brand agnostic and loves to try new brands and styles. He rarely shops in person and likes to do most of his apparel shopping online. Getting the right fit and style is important to him.

## Summary of Findings
Users have had a generally positive response to our idea and suggested workflow. For the most part, the flows were easy to follow and the instructions/guides on the website helped them understand what to do next. 

Common issues encountered during testing:
- In the camera page, the "Record" keyword on the button that starts the capture countdown for taking images is confusing. Users expected the button to take a video rather than take an image. 
- Users were unsure of how to get their style recommendations once measurements were calculated. They were unaware of what the style recommendation service could do for them and opted to return to the page they were routed to EzraFit from. The lack of clarity on what features EzraFit has outside of sizing caused them to abandon the application after getting their size. 
- Once on the user page (where the recommendation features are), users were confused by what they saw. They were expecting to see their recommendations upfront (since they came from a button labelled 'Get Style Recommendations') and not 'my measurements', or a place for them to set their preferences. They also did not know to scroll to see the features available to them.
- Users were confused about routing to the apparel brand’s page once finished at EzraFit. Specifically they could not tell the difference between ‘Continue Shopping’ and ‘See Recommendations,’ and were not sure where each would take.
- Once routed back to the product page, users would have preferred having their recommended size auto-selected, rather than just displayed underneath the sizes. 

Feedback we received:
- Move the Recommendations tab to the top to make it more clear what we want to achieve (fill survey, add images)
- The text under the Recommendations is too small, so it looks more like the Privacy Policy. Text like this is easily ignored, so we should change the way it looks to make important information more evident.
- Instead of routing to another website, we should consider using a modal on the apparel brand’s website instead. This may make the product an easier sell, since users don’t have to move away from the main website.
- A question was raised about what to wear while taking pictures for size. We should explicitly state this requirement on our website to ensure users get the most out of the technology.
