# UX Research Raw Notes

## Scenarios Presented

1. You don’t know your size for a product. What can you do to find out?
    - Expected user actions: To navigate to EzraFit from the apparel store’s website and follow the workflow to get your size
2. Explore other features EzraFit has to offer (once size has been calculated)
    - Expected user actions: To reach EzraFit’s style recommender to personalize clothing recommendations users receive
3. Tell EzraFit what clothes you’d like to see. You can manually enter your preferences or add images of styles you’d like to replicate
    - Expected user actions: To use the form or upload images to analyze style preferences for the recommender
4. View your results (size and style)
    - Expected user actions: To navigate back to the apparel store’s website, to view all recommendations or return to the single product page you accessed EzraFit from.


## UX Research with Julian
1. Julian asked questions about what to wear while taking photos of your body to get accurate measurements.
2. ‘Record’ keyword for image capture is confusing. Though Julian was able to guess what it meant, his first instinct was that a video would be taken instead of an image.
3. Once his size was calculated and he returned to the single-product page, Julian would have liked to have his size automatically selected, rather than just mentioned on the screen.
4. ‘Continue Shopping’ button is ambiguous. It should say something like ‘Return to Store’ or ‘Return to Item’ instead.
5. When opening the user page, there were some issues
    - Expected a marketplace of sorts with product recommendations 
    - Expected to be directed to a style recommendation form instead of the user page. He did not know where to find the style recommendation features and did not expect the need to scroll to find the primary service we are offering on that page.
6. The recommendations tab on the user page with the instructions underneath (which tells the user that they need to set style preferences or upload photos) was at the very bottom of the page, even though this was the very thing the user was expecting to see when they opened the page.
7. The text for the instructions under the recommendations tab is too small. Because of this, it looked like a privacy policy, so he ignored it, didn't read it, and didn't know how to get his recommendations.
8. After we pointed out the instructions underneath the recommendation tab, he wanted to click on the underlined text (which said "setting preferences" and "uploading style inspiration images") in order to set his preferences or upload images.
9. Julian suggested that a pop-up modal on the apparel brand's website would be an easier sell to businesses. He mentioned that brands integrating with EzraFit would want to minimize the time users spend outside their website. 
10. He suggested making the recommendations feature more at the forefront with better prompts for users to know how to navigate within EzraFit. This includes making forms and image upload options more apparent as soon as you enter the app, rather than having to scroll through the User Page to find these features. 


## UX Research with Sarah
1. Sarah knew that she needed to click the button for getting the EzraFit recommended size (the button that says "Not sure? Try EzraFit") and had no trouble with taking images
2. Seemed to have some confusion with the record button, she expected it to show a camera, not take a picture
3. Did not really realize that the style recommendations existed until she got to the user page
4. She was more inclined to just get her size rather than do the recommendation
5. Was very confused on the main user page, she did not know where to look for recommendations
6. She did not realize you can scroll
7. Clicking on survey part made the screen scroll up, which was confusing to her. Note: This was an issue with the prototype and is not a feature we plan to implement. However, we must remember to prevent screen reloads. 
8. Was easily able to add preferences once she scrolled down and saw what was required
9. Had some confusion between the ‘Continue Shopping’ and ‘Get Recommendations' button because she was scrolling all the way down. She only went to the 'Contine Shopping' button because we asked her to. Otherwise her instinct would have been to click on ‘Get Recommendations’ to be routed to the initial brand page. 
10. Back on Zoey’s page, she didn't not know you could scroll down again so she didn't see the EzraFit recommendations under the original image of the item
11. She clicked on the ‘Zoey’s Boutique’ logo and then filtered by EzraFit recommendations to get them 


## UX Research with Ayush
1. Ayush had a little difficulty understanding what “Not sure?” was referring to on the product page. 
2. Found it intuitive to start taking photos but found ‘Record’ a little counterintuitive.
3. Was able to navigate back to the product after taking measurements. Mentioned that he would have liked the size to be selected automatically
4. He found the user page a bit confusing and did not know where to find the recommendations.
5. Mentioned that he would have liked recommendations to be near the top of the page rather than at the bottom
6. While entering preferences, he was a bit confused since it redirected to the same page and the top half of the page looked the same as before. Mentioned that he would have liked a pop up modal where you can enter preferences and add style images if you like. 
7. Liked that you could filter by “EzraFit Recommended”
8. Mentioned that he does not like being redirected to a new page and would rather have the service as a pop up on the main website.
