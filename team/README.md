People at Ezra
---

Our team comprises of 6 individuals who have technical and soft skills that complement the others.

We have elected Anjali Parikh to lead the team. She has a lot of leadership experience such as being a CS ambassador, and leading Women in CS. She is enrolled in both 454 and 491 so she will have the ability to keep track of both courses. She also helped drive creating principles and we believe this worked well for the entire team.

The Leader will be responsible for the following:

- giving reminders in the #Ezra channel
- helping to lead discussions during meetings
- making sure everyone is on track for deadlines
- acting as a tie breaker when the team has difficulties agreeing on a decision
