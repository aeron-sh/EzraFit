# Team Principles

## Communication
- Team members will mainly communicate using private slack channels
- We expect everyone to check the Slack groups at least once a day (Monday to Friday). If you cannot check the group for longer than 1 day, you must inform the team so we know not to expect a response.
    - #Ezra channel: will be used to confirm meetings, handle assignment questions, and remind people to complete tasks related to CSC454
    - A subchannel for CSC491: same as #Ezra, but specifically for CSC491
        - All team members will have access to this channel to stay up to date, but only CSC491 members are responsible for checking it and responding to comments / concerns
- Make sure to acknowledge when other members have reached out to you or the group by reacting with an emoji or comment:
    - `:eyes:` üëÄ- you are taking a look at the comment / concern
    - `:question:` ‚ùì - you do not know the answer to the question / are confused about a comment
    - `:thumbs-up:` üëç - okay / doing it / working on it
    - `:check-mark:`  ‚úÖ - completed / resolved
- Emergencies: We will collect and pin members‚Äô phone numbers in the Slack channel to contact in case of emergencies. This mode of communication is meant only for rare cases, such as if they have not responded after a day.


## Meetings 
- We will have, at minimum, these team meetings:
    - Weekly, after CSC454 lecture, in person, for updates (MON ~9-10pm)
    - For each assignment:
    - Initial meeting: when assignment is released.
        - This should usually be after or during class, so everyone must come to class!
    - Midway meeting: at least 3 days prior to the due date.
    - Final meeting: one day prior to the deadline for the assignment.
    - Potentially more frequent updates closer to the due date.
- Members are responsible for attending team meetings ‚Äì if they are not able to make it, they must let the team know as soon as possible in #Ezra group chat.
    - They must compensate for their absence. I.e. message in the #ezra group chat, review meeting minutes to catch up on what you missed and deliver your updates via the slack channel or through another group member.
- Have a rotation of all members to take meeting minutes


## Work
- Delegate work evenly during our team meetings. Members must communicate ASAP if the assigned work is more complicated or time consuming than anticipated. In this case, the other team members should help out.
- Delegated work will be recorded on GitHub issues. 
- Internal deadlines are set to 1 day before the due date, giving others at least a day to review.
If you require an extension, let the team know ASAP, and we can request it collectively. Extension requests should not be left to the day before the due date. 
- If you are making big changes to someone else's work, notify them and explain why the change is necessary.
- Schedule time to work collaboratively. This schedule is subject to change. 
- Coding
    - Create and adhere to a coding conventions document.
    - Each PR requires at least 2 people's approval before it can be merged. 


## Conflict resolution:
- If two members have an issue, try to talk it out. If they cannot come to a decision, ask another member of the team not involved in the issue to weigh in. If it is still not resolved, we will have a team discussion where the majority vote wins.
