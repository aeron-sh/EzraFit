## About Jaryl

Jaryl is a curious individual who enjoys reading up about new Machine Learning models and utilising them in different ways for his own nefarious gains. He also happens to be a Year 3 Business Analytics student from National University of Singapore who came over on a work-study exchange programme (NOC). Decently comfortable with full stack development (but would prefer to defer to you guys for the backend) and Machine Learning model training, Jaryl would love to learn more about business and work together in a team!

## Strengths

- Adept at coming up with ideas
- Willing to learn and adapt to new team dynamics
- Effective communicator and vocal in raising issues (if he sees any)

## Weaknesses

- Highly mediocre in everything (aka jack of all trades, master of none)
- Easily distracted
- Can be unprofessional at the wrong times
